## First Week at Metis

My first week at the Metis data science bootcamp in Chicago is in the books, so I thought I would reflect on it briefly. The material for week one was largely review, with an emphasis on working with and understanding the theory of the python language. We were introduced to several useful libraries and python packages including matplotlib, pandas, and numpy. Additionally, we worked with using git for version control. I found the pace to be quick, but manageable, and certainly feel that my familiarity with the basic Data Science toolkit has improved tremendously in just 4 days. 

I have also enjoyed getting to know my classmates and instructors over the first week. There is quite a variety in backgrounds, but everyone is very capable and we all seem to be more or less on the same level with respect to experience. I'm definitely excited about working with this group over the next few months.

##Project Benson

Our first project began on day one and was completed by Friday afternoon. Project benson involved some exploratory data analysis for a hypothetical philanthropic organization looking to optimize recruitment efforts for an event based on New York City MTA subway passenger data. The rest of this post will be dedicated to a breakdown of my team's project approach, and the link to our final report can be found [placeholder.] (www.google.com)

###Problem and Initial Approach
Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY), a non-profit group dedicated to increasing female representation in tech fields, has an upcoming fundraising Gala. The tickets to the event are free, but WTWY wants to target individuals who are likely to join the organization and contribute financially. They would like to leverage MTA subway turnstile data to determine how best to optimize their recruitment resources outside selected subway stations in New York City.

After examining some of the available [data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html), our team elected to pursue the acquisition of additional data that would provide more detail on demographics in an effort to stress "quality over quantity" with respect to targeting recruits. We determined that, given the vast scale of the turnstile data, it would be appropriate to first narrow our scope by including additional data sources, namely, demographic information on New York City residents from the US Census.
