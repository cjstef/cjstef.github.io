Welcome to my personal homepage. The purpose of this blog is to demonstrate some of the projects I have been working on as I begin my career in data science. Many of the projects will be through my participation in the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) data science bootcamp.

This site was built using the Jekyll framework.
